This project utilizes Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, to display a map interface where users can mark the starting point of their cycling journey. 
When a user clicks on the map, a form appears, allowing them to input details such as distance, duration, and elevation of their cycling activity. 
After submitting the form, a marker is placed on the map at the specified location, and the submitted values, along with the date of the activity, 
are displayed in a card format on the left side of the page. The application is responsive, adjusting its layout for different devices, 
with a mobile-friendly design that places the form and submitted values above the map on smaller screens.
Overall, this project provides a user-friendly way for cyclists to log and visualize their biking adventures.
